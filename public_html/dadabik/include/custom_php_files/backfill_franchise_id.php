// Backfill franchise_id -- one-off administrative page, not a regular extraction stage.
//
// Confirmed root cause: none of the 6 NCAA5 uploads had franchise_id resolved, which is why
// none appeared in Extract Play-by-Play's dropdown (it requires franchise_id IS NOT NULL).
// The hook's franchise_id resolution logic (operational_hooks.php step 3b) is present and
// looks structurally sound -- not obviously broken for NCAA5 specifically. Since hooks only
// ever fire once, at insert time, the far more likely explanation is that these particular
// uploads were ingested before this step existed in the hook (or before a later fix to it),
// leaving them permanently stuck with franchise_id=NULL with no way to retroactively trigger
// the hook again. This page reuses that exact same logic (same regex, same lookup, same
// update call) against any existing upload still missing it, rather than re-implementing it
// differently and risking a subtly different result.
